    <div class="text-block"><p1><h1><u>DIGITAL MARKETING</u></h1>Any marketing that uses electronic devices and can be used by marketing specialists to convey promotional messaging and measure its impact through your 
        customer journey. In practice, digital marketing typically refers to marketing campaigns that appear on a computer, phone, tablet, or other device. It can take many forms, including online video, display ads, 
        search engine marketing, paid social ads and social media posts. Digital marketing is often compared to “traditional marketing” such as magazine ads, billboards, and direct mail. Oddly, television is usually lumped in with traditional marketing.</p1>

   <p2><h2><u>WHY DIGITAL MARKETING IS IMPORTENT ?</u></h2>Any type of marketing can help your business thrive. However, digital marketing has become increasingly important because of how accessible digital channels are. In fact, there were 5 billion internet users globally in April 2022 alone.
    From social media to text messages, there are many ways to use digital marketing tactics in order to communicate with your target audience. Additionally, digital marketing has minimal upfront costs, making it a cost-effective marketing technique for small businesses.</p2>
